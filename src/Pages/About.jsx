      </h2>

      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-justify">
        I'm <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">Harithaa Srii</span>, a frontend engineer with 1 year of enterprise experience building production-grade applications with Angular and TypeScript. I have a strong Java foundation, understand full-stack architecture, and adaptively build with modern frameworks like React. I translate Figma designs into pixel-perfect, high-performance interfaces and architect component systems built for scale.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
        At <span className="font-medium">MapleLabs Solutions</span>, I built scalable Angular applications with TypeScript in production environments, implemented lazy loading and code-splitting for performance optimization, and developed reusable component libraries used by cross-functional teams. I collaborated with backend engineers on API integration, learned microservices architecture, and shipped features end-to-end. I'm proficient in <span className="font-medium">Angular, React, TypeScript, RxJS, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS</span>, with strong foundations in <span className="font-medium">Java</span> and currently expanding into backend development with <span className="font-medium">Spring Boot</span>.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
        Beyond my day-to-day work, I build full-stack projects to deepen my engineering foundation—like an <span className="font-medium">AI-powered resume analyzer</span> (React + APIs + authentication) and interactive components showcasing advanced animations and responsive design. These projects prove my ability to adapt across frameworks and understand the full product lifecycle. I hold a <span className="font-medium">Bachelor's degree in Information Technology (2024)</span>.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
        I'm actively expanding my backend knowledge with Spring Boot and full-stack development to strengthen my engineering foundation and write more informed, architecture-aware frontend code. I'm seeking roles where I can contribute high-quality, production-grade frontend work and grow as a full-stack engineer—with teams that value clean code, scalability, and user-centric design.
